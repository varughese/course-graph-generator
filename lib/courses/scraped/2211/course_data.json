Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that religious identities are often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that religion and race are both modern categories rooted in post-enlightenment ideas about what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in European imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples. In particular, we will think about the impact of white supremacy on black religion in the united states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, and contemporary Islamophobia in the US. Finally, we will explore the possibilities of anti-racism through faith-based scholarship and activism.",

The options and issues affecting the deployment and utilization of business information systems have grown in number and greatly increased in complexity since the internet and concomitant technologies have become the most important de-facto standards for business computing and networking. Business people who are involved in technology selection and deployment decisions need a basic knowledge of these areas as well as an understanding the value, costs and benefits they might offer to a business. They also must be able to find out about and evaluate new or emerging technologies and issues that could have relevance in their business situations. They then need to be able to explain all of this to other business people - in business terms.  This course will utilize: lectures and presentations by the instructor and outside speakers to present current and relevant architectures and issues that affect businesses deploying information systems; full-length case studies and class discussion to facilitate the examination of the business implications of and the context in which these system deployment factors are involved; team projects to give the students experience in researching, understanding, evaluating and explaining information technologies and issues within a business context.",

In addition, the Internet and e-commerce explosion of the late 1990s has created an even wider need to design corporate websites and apps. Designers and developers should take into account what we know about human factors engineering to improve the user experience (UX). This course focuses on how to gather requirements, achieve a usable first draft, and test and improve that draft. A half-dozen course projects include usability critiques, assessments of users' difficulties in understanding systems, and designs of forms, screen layouts, and icons. A running major project in four parts provides a usability critique of a website or app, followed by empirical tests of usability, followed by suggestions for improvement, and finally, empirical tests of prototype screens (using an easy tool) that would implement improvements. A final presentation is a summary of all four stages that is intended to convince management to provide funds to make the changes.",

Six Sigma utilizes the following five-phase problem-solving methodology known by the acronym DMAIC:  1. Define the projects, the goals, and the deliverables to customers (internal and external).  Describe and quantify both the defect and the expected improvement.  2. Measure the current performance of the process.  Validate data to make sure it is credible and set the baseline.  3. Analyze and determine the root cause(s) of the defects.  Narrow the causal factors to the vital few.  4. Improve the process to eliminate defects.  Optimize the vital few and their interrelationships.  5. Control the performance of the process.  Lock down the gains.  BUSSCM 1780 six sigma is designed to provide the student not only with strong theoretical knowledge of the Six Sigma green belt body of knowledge, but also with practical, hands-on, experience-based learning through the application of Six Sigma tools and techniques via in-class labs.",

This collaborative course sequence engages the students in learning approaches towards antibiotic discovery in order to address the world's current antibiotic crisis. Students start out in the biology course by isolating bacterial strains that display antibiotic activity. This biology course is followed up with the organic chemistry lab course that affords the students the opportunity to develop strategies for antibiotic isolation and purification using chemical separation techniques, and to characterize these unknown antibiotics through spectroscopic techniques commonly used in organic chemistry.  Students are encouraged to take the biology Small World course (BIOSC 0067) prior to this CURE Organic Chemistry Lab course.

In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.",

Seminar in Composition: Engineering undertakes the goals of Seminar in Composition within a first-year (and beyond) engineering context. First-year Swanson School of Engineering (SSOE) students in Seminar in Composition: Engineering will explore engineering disciplines, practices, methods, ethics, and education and will analyze their own views and goals as engineering students and as future engineers as they are learning about and practicing writing as a rigorous, disciplined form of critical inquiry and a responsible form of communication. In Seminar in Composition: Engineering, students will strengthen their knowledge and practice of the textual conventions required of university- and professional-level writing and will, via drafting and revision, regularly reexamine the clarity and effects of their writing processes and outcomes. Writing instruction will take place in the ENGR 0011 or 0711 classroom, so students won't have a separate class meeting for ENGCMP 0210; be sure that your ENGR and ENGCMP courses meet at the same day and time in the same classroom.",

            "description": "Seminar in Composition is a course taken by almost all undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh. Its goals are to help you engage in writing as a creative, disciplined form of critical inquiry; compose thoughtfully crafted essays that position your ideas among other views; write with precision, nuance, and awareness of textual conventions; and revise your writing by rethinking the assumptions, aims, and effects of prior drafts. This seminar will include readings and writing activities that explore concepts and practices relating to diversity and its established and emerging definitions. Your section may address, for example, issues like race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religious difference, differences in abilities, and economic disparities. You can expect to identify and analyze assumptions about difference, study how texts can generate and perpetuate such assumptions, and explore the consequences of such assumptions. You will also learn how to research and compose with attention to difference. We will read a challenging set of essays to frame our work in the course, but the key texts will be your own writings and those of your classmates. Your focus on student writing will be detailed: you will work closely with the papers that you and your fellow classmates have written, trying to think of ways to make them more precise, interesting, organized, complex, and reflexive. This course is an opportunity to learn how to use reading (published texts, the papers of your classmates, and readers' comments) to help you work on your writing and how to use writing to help you strengthen ways of reading and thinking. Like other seminars in composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world.

This Topics in Diversity section of WPC will invite students to expand and complicate their understanding of the benefits of workplace diversity and of the problems arising from the unequal distribution of power and privilege across positions (including race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class) in the professions. Students will explore the dynamics of power and hierarchy in their chosen field as they observe daily operations and interactions during work-site field visits, and they will consider how these dynamics perpetuate or diminish inequities and marginalization. Among the topics considered are discrimination in hiring and on the job in terms of employment training, responsibilities, pay, and promotions. Students gain practice articulating their individual diversity as job candidates in resumes and cover letters, and in composing professional documents that address a complaint, seek a remedy, and establish new policies to address hypothetical discriminatory issues that they may experience in the future.",

Students will gain familiarity with the formal requirements of biomedical abstracts, literature reviews, and research papers, and they will learn effective strategies for conducting secondary research using health science databases and search engines. The course will also introduce techniques for improving documents, structure and style, so that readers can easily grasp, follow, and absorb the significance of the information presented. Students will be introduced to expectations and challenges they are likely to encounter in other common writing scenarios, such as explaining complex information to patients, writing reports for administrators or regulatory agencies, and communication policies or procedures to staff. Different approaches to writing graduate and professional school personal statements will be discussed, and students will draft and revise either personal statements for applications or mission statements articulating their professional visions within a larger ethical framework. Through the course of the term students will work towards completion of a final paper on a medical communication issue, and they will present their findings in a conference-style format, at the end of the semester.",

The course provides students with the opportunity to develop a portfolio of practical and analytical policy-related writing by grounding our work in current discussions about diversity (including race, gender, LGBT+, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class). In this writing-intensive class, students will write a variety of documents, such as a history memo, a set of responses to the readings, a letter of public comment, an op-ed, a polemical essay, and a final policy memo, related to a specific and properly-scaled diversity policy issue. The course will address the specialized use of language, conventions and formats, premises, motives, and purposes related to policy documents and arguments in light of diversity. By preparing both reflective academic and professional policy documents, students will master not only the basics of policy writing, but, through their own research and writing, the rhetorical and critical thinking skills necessary to create effective policy. Students will learn to employ methods of inquiry, analysis, and composition characteristic of written and oral policy discussions as they relate to diversity questions, concerns, and legal requirements. We will read broadly and deeply, and engaged, informed class discussion responding to reading and current policy questions is a cornerstone of the class. We will explore how the explicit and implicit history and applications of public and private policies have created long-standing outcomes that are often taken for granted, and address ways to change and improve those outcomes.",

The course is for responsible students who are interested in writing for this journal or running social media to promote the journal. The team will work with a teacher who will serve as managing editor and also faculty member in charge of the project. The group will learn about writing, editing, and PR while producing the online literary magazine. You can also expect to learn more about free speech and social justice while working with writers who are under threat in their home countries. Weekly meetings on campus will focus on learning about the context for the work, learning good practices for professional writing, editing, and PR, reading work by writers in exile, and workshopping your articles for publication. Interviews for articles will be in-person or via Skype. Expect to spend 10-12 hours a week working on this project. You will also need to attend class. A monthly meeting will be held at City of Asylum on the Northside (easily accessible by bus).",

Making is situated at the intersection of social media, the online gift economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with one's physical environment. Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures -the free sharing of code to enable collaborative development - making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. MakerSpaces and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the Internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will begin by looking at the history and philosophy of open source software development, and then the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have together given rise to critical maker culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printing assignments, students will form groups and develop collaborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a topic of your choice and in a medium of your choice. The aim of this course is to \"close the circuit\" between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. Critical making is about critically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. By the end of the semester, you will become a critical maker!

Importantly, how do these emerging \"types\" of manufacturing differ from traditional manufacturing?  It is important to recognize that global manufacturing is undergoing major transformations nowadays. The confluence of new advanced materials, emerging fabrication technologies, and connected cyber-physical systems is creating paradigm shifts for the ways products are conceived, made, distributed, used, and disposed.  In the ever-increasing competition of \"making things\" of value to consumers, many industries are now reinventing themselves to cope with this new reality.  This class covers the fundamentals behind major global trends, and their implication for the future of manufacturing from an engineering perspective. Topics covered include the following:   (1) How the need for flexible and wearable devices is driving innovation in new materials and fabrication processes beyond the traditional microfabrication techniques adopted in the semiconductor industry.    (2) How protein-based materials, degradable polymers, and novel recycling technologies are paving the way for more sustainable manufacturing of consumer products.  (3) How data analytics and internet of things (IoT) technologies are enabling a new generation of digital manufacturing systems referred to as Industry 4.0, and beyond.",

In this course, we will explore tools and techniques for inventing, designing and prototyping systems. This course is based on experiential learning: through interactive discussions, small-team exercises, maker assignments, workshops and hands-on projects, students will obtain an introduction to design thinking, 'maker culture' and systems engineering. ENGR 1716 is an upper division version of freshman honors ENGR 0716.  It is for sophomore, junior and senior level students. We will explore user-centric design principles, low-resolution prototyping and experience prototyping, basic building elements for systems such as sensors, computer controllers, actuators and displays, materials and methods for prototyping, and ways to analyze and troubleshoot systems. Students will gain an introduction to 'smart systems': automated systems that can sense the world and automatically respond in useful ways. We will also focus on the user interface: how to create control and display interfaces that enhance users' ability to operate systems effectively and efficiently.",
