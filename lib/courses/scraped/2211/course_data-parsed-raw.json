We will consider sex and sexuality as they are related to other categories of identity, including race, class, ethnicity, nation, and ability. Our theoretical and historical investigations will create the groundwork for understanding and rethinking how sexuality is understood in culture today.","id":"GSWS0550","major":"GSWS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"GSWS1140":{"className":"SPECIAL TOPICS","classNumber":"1140","credits":"3 units","description":"This upper-level course addresses a current topic in gender, sexuality, or women's studies.

The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.","id":"HAA0018","major":"HAA","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"HAA0020":{"className":"INTRODUCTION TO ASIAN ART","classNumber":"0020","credits":"3 units","description":"This base level survey is meant, on the one hand, to introduce the student to the arts of Japan, China, and India and on the other, to teach some fundamental techniques of visual analysis.

We will begin by considering the concepts of 'health', 'disease' and 'illness' in general, and several different models of medicine. From there we will move on to a consideration of the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We will examine some explanatory successes in the domain of physical health and disease, and consider how those successes were achieved. In the second half of the course we will look at controversies over the question of whether there is such a thing as mental illness, and if so, how one is to define, diagnose and treat it. In order to better understand what is at stake, we will explore these controversies by focusing on a specific mental illness, schizophrenia. Looking at recent research on schizophrenia will allow us to see the extent to which the kind of understanding we have achieved in physical medicine is or is not to be expected with serious mental illness. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medicine and psychiatry; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about foundational questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers.

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to Certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently.  The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.","id":"HPS0613","major":"HPS","recitation":true,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"HPS0618":{"className":"SCIENTIFIC CONTROVERSIES","classNumber":"0618","credits":"3 units","description":"DSAS Phil.

It is often said that America is the only place in the world that treats death as optional.  Once upon a time, we couldn't have open, public conversations about breast cancer, because the word could not be uttered aloud.  In many places, it is just as hard today to have an open, public conversation about death and dying.  This phenomenon is not just a social more; it affects the practice of many professions and entire segments of our economy and society.  This course will explore our individual and cultural reactions to mortality, the ways in which dying in today's America is different from dying throughout history or elsewhere in the world, and the responses of a variety of professions, both within the field of healthcare and beyond, to their encounters with people in the various stages of dying.

But given competing definitions of fairness, how should we decide what it means for an algorithm to be unbiased? Machine vision algorithms are systematically less likely to recognize faces of people of color. Since many face recognition algorithms are used for surveillance, would improving these algorithms promote justice? Deep fakes may pose serious challenges to democratic discourse, as faked videos of political leaders making incendiary statements cast doubt on the provenance of real videos. Do the researchers developing these algorithms, often academics funded by National Science Foundation grants, have an obligation to desist? In a field filled with such vexing questions, the ethical issue most commonly addressed by the media is whether a self-driving car should swerve to hit one person to avoid hitting two.  In this class, we will go beyond the headlines to explore the ethics of technology. We will discuss issues such as transparency, bias and fairness, surveillance, automation and work, the politics of artifacts, the epistemology of deep fakes, and more.

Hence: politics. The course considers how the U.S. and other governments develop policies aimed at ensuring a sufficient, nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable, and sustainable food supply.  Drawing on contemporary case studies, it examines: why and how governments establish food and nutrition policies; how stakeholders in the food system use the political system to influence policy; the cultural, social, economic, and political factors that influence stakeholder and government positions on policy issues.","id":"PS1357","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1381":{"className":"CAPSTONE SEMINAR IN COMPARATIVE POLITICS","classNumber":"1381","credits":"3 units","description":"Capstones are writing intensive courses for senior, PS majors.

This class is meant to be a gentle introduction to the emerging field of computational social science, where we study the opportunities and challenges with both collecting and exploring digitally available political and social information such as text, geo-locations and social media connections to better understand human decisions and interactions. We begin by going back to basics, exploring the reasons and ways individuals and policy-makers use and misuse data. We then turn our focus to flexible computational tools for data collection and visualization and how they can provide unique help in answering important questions such as what causes war and violence, who represses human rights, and what parties are likely to win elections. By the end of the class, students will be exposed not only to coding and computer languages that are often used in data analytics in industry, government and academia, including bash, Python and R, but how these languages can be used to better understand the changing digital world that surrounds us.","id":"PS1702","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1900":{"className":"INTERNSHIP","classNumber":"1900","credits":"0","description":"","id":"PS1900","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1901":{"className":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","classNumber":"1901","credits":"0","description":"","id":"PS1901","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1902":{"className":"DIRECTED READING","classNumber":"1902","credits":"0","description":"","id":"PS1902","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1903":{"className":"DIRECTED RESEARCH","classNumber":"1903","credits":"0","description":"","id":"PS1903","major":"PS","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"PS1910":{"className":"INSTITUTE OF POLITICS INTERNSHIP/SEMINAR","classNumber":"1910","credits":"4 units","description":"Students selected for the institute of politics internship will register for this course for the experiential component of their internships.

We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in european imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples.

In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased \"investment\" in religion. In addition to the study of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in premodern China, the course ends by looking at contemporary beliefs and practices and issues of politics, class, and gender. Our purpose is to gain some exposure to Chinese religious thought and practice, to identify dominant themes underlying Chinese values and behavior, and to explore the syncretic nature of religion in China as each tradition finds expression in and comes to influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture.

We will examine academic articles, essays, poems, narratives, films, videos and paintings that explore the relationship between plants, spirituality an healing as constructed by popular, indigenous and Afrodescendant traditions in Latin America. These expressions offer insightful approaches that contribute to an ongoing critical discussion concerning these topics. Given that our purpose is to address artistic and philosophical aspects that relate to peoples' conceptions about spirituality, health and healing, which in-of-themselves constitute an essential part of any comprehensive approach to health in general, this course does not specifically address the empirical therapeutic value (of lack of ) of specific practices. Section I will discuss current global and national contexts of traditional medicine.  Section II will provide an overview of significant issues in Latin American ethnobotany.  Section III will analyze the fundamental metaphysics and ethics of Amerindian myth and ritual.  Section IV will examine literary works and films that provide critical insights to contemporary philosophies of spirituality and healing, and, as the arts usually do, connect these insights to a sundry array of contemporary issues, opening up unexpected vistas.  Geo-cultural matrices of examined works include indigenous and Afrodescendant societies in Mexico, Central America, the Andes, Amazonia, and he Caribbean (Haiti-Dominican Republic), as well as urban societies in Bolivia, Colombia, and Argentina.","id":"SPAN1458","major":"SPAN","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"PREQ: SPAN 1250","tree":{"prereq":"SPAN1250","coreq":null}}},"SPAN1806":{"className":"CAPSTONE SEMINAR","classNumber":"1806","credits":"3 units","description":" ","id":"SPAN1806","major":"SPAN","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"SPAN1901":{"className":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","classNumber":"1901","credits":"0","description":"","id":"SPAN1901","major":"SPAN","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"SPAN1902":{"className":"DIRECTED STUDY","classNumber":"1902","credits":"0","description":"","id":"SPAN1902","major":"SPAN","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}},"SPAN1906":{"className":"SPANISH INTERNSHIP FOR CREDIT","classNumber":"1906","credits":"0","description":"","id":"SPAN1906","major":"SPAN","recitation":false,"reqs":{"text":"","tree":{"prereq":null,"coreq":null}}}},"STAT":{"STAT0200":{"className":"BASIC APPLIED STATISTICS","classNumber":"0200","credits":"4 units","description":"This course teaches methods of descriptive and inferential statistics.

Even if sayings such as \"paying my debt to society\" are still in use, it is becoming more and more evident - especially in a time of mass incarceration - how incarceration as punishment cannot be the only solution.

Students will be exposed to the multidisciplinary evolution of ethnography from its origins to its application in an urban context. What is ethnography? Specifically, what is urban ethnography? These are the two critical questions that will be answered in this course. We will focus on topics of neighborhood/city membership, gentrification, community, belonging and the importance of place and space. Specifically, we will try to answer the following questions: Who owns the city? Who has a right to the city? Who controls the city? Despite a vast body of literature that illustrates issues of gentrification; we will critically examine controversial debates surrounding ¿Who has a right to the city?¿ that is situated in the process of gentrification. We will interrogate both the assumption that ¿gentrification¿ is good or bad for neighborhoods and their residents.  In doing so, we will investigate the processes of redevelopment, housing, displacement, resettlement, employment and transportation. In this course we will engage in a semester-long ethnographic project focusing on the idea of belonging, of neighborhood, of urban sentiment, of feeling rooted (or disconnected) to a specific area (street, neighborhood, area, city, etc.).  Students will learn how to do urban ethnography by conducting a research project on the notion of belonging. What does it mean to belong to a place or space? Who defines who belongs and who doesn't? Is it a self-defined status? Is belonging acquired through residency? Or rather involvement? Can a neighborhood be open to newcomers and still preserve an identity? Who defines the identity of a place? All of these questions are at the core of discourses surrounding gentrification and redevelopment, and will be explored using urban ethnography. Ethnography ¿ the method of social research that use full immersion of researchers in their fieldwork to isolate and focus on issues of culture ¿ can be an excellent tool to start a more in depth exploration of such questions surrounding urban culture. This course will prepare students to be proficient in the practice of ethnography. Specifically, it will teach students how to do: 1. A literature review related to belonging, gentrification, and rights to the city; 2. Create a theoretically informed thesis statement; 3. Explain how a project is related to wider social issues concerning Neighborhood, Gentrification, Belonging, and the City; 4. Collect relevant ethnographic data related to the topic; 5. Discuss the significance of the findings; 6. Write a conclusion that is data driven; 7.
