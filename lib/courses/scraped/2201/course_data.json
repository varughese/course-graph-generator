Collaboration, then, the process of creating in partnership, in community, is an expression of the practice of poetics at its most dynamic.

They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the late second millennium BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a small group of absolute monotheists based in Jerusalem in the mid-first millennium BCE. Students will become more sophisticated readers of biblical texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect not a homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polytheism. By appropriating and reinterpreting the religious myths of their neighbors, the Israelites arrived at a character of the divine that has proven problematic to many contemporary theologians, particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.",

Each course in the series is stand-alone and, as such, is not a prerequisite for any other course in the series. Students may take one, two, or all three courses.  Artificial organs 2 is focused on artificial blood and artificial lung. The basic physiology of each system (blood and the lungs) is reviewed with emphasis on identifying the bioengineering design requirements for appropriate organ replacement systems.

They also must be able to find out about and evaluate new or emerging technologies and issues that could have relevance in their business situations. They then need to be able to explain all of this to other business people - in business terms.  This course will utilize: lectures and presentations by the instructor and outside speakers to present current and relevant architectures and issues that affect businesses deploying information systems; full-length case studies and class discussion to facilitate the examination of the business implications of and the context in which these system deployment factors are involved; team projects to give the students experience in researching, understanding, evaluating and explaining information technologies and issues within a business context.",

Describe and quantify both the defect and the expected improvement.  2. Measure the current performance of the process.  Validate data to make sure it is credible and set the baseline.  3. Analyze and determine the root cause(s) of the defects.  Narrow the causal factors to the vital few.  4. Improve the process to eliminate defects.  Optimize the vital few and their interrelationships.  5. Control the performance of the process.  Lock down the gains.

This collaborative course sequence engages the students in learning approaches towards antibiotic discovery in order to address the world's current antibiotic crisis. Students start out in the biology course by isolating bacterial strains that display antibiotic activity. This biology course is followed up with the organic chemistry lab course that affords the students the opportunity to develop strategies for antibiotic isolation and purification using chemical separation techniques, and to characterize these unknown antibiotics through spectroscopic techniques commonly used in organic chemistry.  Students are encouraged to take the biology Small World course (BIOSC 0067) prior to this CURE Organic Chemistry Lab course.

            "description": "The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.",

How does monetary  policy affect  financial markets and the real economy? We will study how monetary policy influences interest rates and asset  markets, such as the bond market and the stock market. We will analyze the effect of asymmetric  information  in corporate  finance, and on the design of financial contracts. We will study the role of financial intermediaries, such as banks, in the economic system and study the economic rationale behind domestic and international banking regulation.  Finally, we will discuss monetary policy.  We will review evidence and theory on how monetary policy affects  real economic activity",

In Seminar in Composition: Engineering, students will strengthen their knowledge and practice of the textual conventions required of university- and professional-level writing and will, via drafting and revision, regularly reexamine the clarity and effects of their writing processes and outcomes.

Its goals are to help you engage in writing as a creative, disciplined form of critical inquiry; compose thoughtfully crafted essays that position your ideas among other views; write with precision, nuance, and awareness of textual conventions; and revise your writing by rethinking the assumptions, aims, and effects of prior drafts. This seminar will include readings and writing activities that explore concepts and practices relating to diversity and its established and emerging definitions. Your section may address, for example, issues like race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religious difference, differences in abilities, and economic disparities. You can expect to identify and analyze assumptions about difference, study how texts can generate and perpetuate such assumptions, and explore the consequences of such assumptions. You will also learn how to research and compose with attention to difference. We will read a challenging set of essays to frame our work in the course, but the key texts will be your own writings and those of your classmates. Your focus on student writing will be detailed: you will work closely with the papers that you and your fellow classmates have written, trying to think of ways to make them more precise, interesting, organized, complex, and reflexive. This course is an opportunity to learn how to use reading (published texts, the papers of your classmates, and readers' comments) to help you work on your writing and how to use writing to help you strengthen ways of reading and thinking. Like other seminars in composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world.

Students will explore theories of persuasive writing for public audiences, as well as argumentative strategies more broadly. Students will define the subject of a core project for the term, and move beyond understanding an issue to understanding various discourse communities that generate writing on that topic, how those organizations represent themselves, and how they define an audience. Our theoretical discussion will be balanced by a more pragmatic look at the language of social change, and how various writing forms\u00bfproduced by nonprofits, activist groups, international organizations and coalitions, as well as socially engaged journalism\u00bfinform, persuade, and engage the public. Students in Writing for Change can expect to compose traditional essays as well as public writing in print, digital, visual, and a variety of other forms of persuasive communication.",

The course provides students with the opportunity to develop a portfolio of practical and analytical policy-related writing by grounding our work in current discussions about diversity (including race, gender, LGBT+, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class). In this writing-intensive class, students will write a variety of documents, such as a history memo, a set of responses to the readings, a letter of public comment, an op-ed, a polemical essay, and a final policy memo, related to a specific and properly-scaled diversity policy issue. The course will address the specialized use of language, conventions and formats, premises, motives, and purposes related to policy documents and arguments in light of diversity. By preparing both reflective academic and professional policy documents, students will master not only the basics of policy writing, but, through their own research and writing, the rhetorical and critical thinking skills necessary to create effective policy. Students will learn to employ methods of inquiry, analysis, and composition characteristic of written and oral policy discussions as they relate to diversity questions, concerns, and legal requirements. We will read broadly and deeply, and engaged, informed class discussion responding to reading and current policy questions is a cornerstone of the class. We will explore how the explicit and implicit history and applications of public and private policies have created long-standing outcomes that are often taken for granted, and address ways to change and improve those outcomes.",

We'll look at how these media work: at the history and theory of their development, at the changes they have brought about in a broader media culture, and at their social status and significance (e.g., The place they occupy in culture, the kinds of interactions they make possible).",

Making is situated at the intersection of social media, the online gift economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with one's physical environment. Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures -the free sharing of code to enable collaborative development - making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. MakerSpaces and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the Internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will begin by looking at the history and philosophy of open source software development, and then the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have together given rise to critical maker culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printing assignments, students will form groups and develop collaborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a topic of your choice and in a medium of your choice. The aim of this course is to \"close the circuit\" between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. Critical making is about critically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. By the end of the semester, you will become a critical maker!",

The term engineer shares its origins with ingenious: one definition of engineer is 'a skillful inventor.' In this course, we will explore tools and techniques for inventing, designing and prototyping systems. This course is based on experiential learning: through interactive discussions, small-team exercises, maker assignments, workshops and hands-on projects, students will obtain an introduction to design thinking, 'maker culture' and systems engineering. ENGR 1716 is an upper division version of freshman honors ENGR 0716.  It is for sophomore, junior and senior level students. We will explore user-centric design principles, low-resolution prototyping and experience prototyping, basic building elements for systems such as sensors, computer controllers, actuators and displays, materials and methods for prototyping, and ways to analyze and troubleshoot systems. Students will gain an introduction to 'smart systems': automated systems that can sense the world and automatically respond in useful ways. We will also focus on the user interface: how to create control and display interfaces that enhance users' ability to operate systems effectively and efficiently.",

To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework.

Ultimately, these materials may be read as a texts that inform our understanding of culture and social life and prompt such questions as: how does popular culture (re)construct our sense of \"ordinary\" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cultural forms dismissed and others more readily accepted? What social processes bring cultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a variety of forms such as: music, art, television, collectibles, internet, and social media. Students will consider examples from Western, non-Western, and \"global\" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, and ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular culture, material culture, representation, and consumerism, and power and resistance.

In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses.

However, tourism has been a central dimension of globalization, and it can be used as a lens to reflect on many questions about identity and heritage, commoditization, historical and cultural representation, authenticity and ownership, neoliberalism, inequality, gender relations, environmental sustainability, and more.

The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.",

The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for many of the same reasons they are complex and even controversial: Surviving primary sources are fragmented, partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this period to legitimize their own positions. The central goal is to develop an understanding of the diversity of voices in this early period and consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced others; and then follow those voices beyond the Arabian Peninsula to examine manifestations in the North African and Central Asian borderlands.",

We approach these traditions through lectures and discussion based on Chinese classical and popular literature, secondary scholarship, and films, which inform us about cultural and historical context, beliefs, practices, and personal experience.

However, during the two world wars and their aftermath acts the civilian population of Central and Eastern Europe experienced a degree of mass violence that not only changed to face of the region but also led to the establishment of the very term \"genocide\". The Holocaust stands out as the most comprehensive, most radically executed case of genocide in modern times. Yet it was embedded in a wider context of systematic violence against various populations in Central and Eastern Europe. Rather than beginning with a general, abstract reflection on the reasons for the various forms of mass violence from ethnic cleansing to genocide, this course allows students to explore the specific social, cultural, and political conditions under which the sometimes entangled cases of mass violence against civilians occurred in twentieth-century Central and Eastern Europe. The course concludes with a general reflection and discussion of the concept of \"genocide\", the limits of its analytical usefulness, and the political baggage it carries.",

The first half of the course will focus on country-specific historical studies, tracing the development path each country has taken in the post-war period. Some common themes repeat themselves in each of the country case studies: the role of the state, the interaction between domestic and international factors, the relationship between bureaucrats and politicians, and the development of various institutions. Other topics and readings highlight national specificities, revealing unique circumstances that differentiate the experiences of one country form another. The second half of the course will focus on common themes and contemporary challenges shared by countries in East Asia including, but not limited to, rapidly aging populations, industrialization and green technology, competition for energy sources and commodities, and food security.",

The origins and development of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, popular and family religion, and religion and the state are presented within an overall historical framework. As China becomes more and more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practices. In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased \"investment\" in religion. In addition to the study of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in premodern China, the course ends by looking at contemporary beliefs and practices and issues of politics, class, and gender. Our purpose is to gain some exposure to Chinese religious thought and practice, to identify dominant themes underlying Chinese values and behavior, and to explore the syncretic nature of religion in China as each tradition finds expression in and comes to influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture. In this way, we hope to come to understand the critical role played by the various traditions in the unfolding of Chinese history and in the formation of the Chinese view of the world.",

Students will become more sophisticated readers of biblical texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect not a homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polytheism. By appropriating and reinterpreting the religious myths of their neighbors, the Israelites arrived at a character of the divine that has proven problematic to many contemporary theologians, particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.",

            "description": "Was the world of Europe and the Middle East before the Enlightenment a period of unending religious conflict and intolerance? Were Jews the victims of severe persecution and violence everywhere during this period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing religious wars? The answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict and competition between the three major western religious groups, they were also a time of coexistence and cooperation. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplistic stereotypes to deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were the theological, political, and legal contexts in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted in both Christian Europe and the Muslim world? How did these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tolerate the religious \"Other\"? When and why did toleration break down and lead to expulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cultural exchanges and cooperation take place in economic, cultural, intellectual, and social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and intolerance) that emerged at the end of the Middle Ages and examine aspects of inter-religious encounters and dialogues today. We will discuss not only the significance of Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but also assess these encounters as a case study in the broader history of religious diversity, pluralism, and conflict.",

We will begin by considering the concepts of 'health', 'disease' and 'illness' in general, and several different models of medicine. From there we will move on to a consideration of the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We will examine some explanatory successes in the domain of physical health and disease, and consider how those successes were achieved. In the second half of the course we will look at controversies over the question of whether there is such a thing as mental illness, and if so, how one is to define, diagnose and treat it. In order to better understand what is at stake, we will explore these controversies by focusing on a specific mental illness, schizophrenia. Looking at recent research on schizophrenia will allow us to see the extent to which the kind of understanding we have achieved in physical medicine is or is not to be expected with serious mental illness. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medicine and psychiatry; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about foundational questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers.

For this reason, they have long been a subject of philosophical enquiry, concerned with the nature of perceptual knowledge. Alongside philosophical investigation, the perceptual modalities (vision, hearing, etc.) Are a central area of experimental research in psychology and neuroscience? Philosophers of perception now seek to integrate their conceptual understanding of the topic with empirical results coming from these sciences. In this course, we will examine debates in contemporary philosophy of perception over the nature of perceptual awareness and sensory knowledge, looking especially at ideas that have been influenced by scientific discoveries. Topics include: nave realism and representationalism; ontology of perceptible qualities (the existence of colour, sound, smell, etc.); the nature of attention and introspection.",

We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideas and issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient near east, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient settings. Of course, because the myths are expressions of human thought, we may find that in studying them we also come to better understand ourselves.",

In the earliest days of that history, God was worshiped as one of a plethora of deities controlling various spheres of cosmic activity or the human world. Students in this course will learn about this ancient pantheon - how gods functioned in society and how their presence was experienced by those devoted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the late second millennium BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a small group of absolute monotheists based in Jerusalem in the mid-first millennium BCE. Students will become more sophisticated readers of biblical texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect not a homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polytheism. By appropriating and reinterpreting the religious myths of their neighbors, the Israelites arrived at a character of the divine that has proven problematic to many contemporary theologians, particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.",

Were Jews the victims of severe persecution and violence everywhere during this period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing religious wars? The answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict and competition between the three major western religious groups, they were also a time of coexistence and cooperation. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplistic stereotypes to deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were the theological, political, and legal contexts in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted in both Christian Europe and the Muslim world? How did these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tolerate the religious \"Other\"? When and why did toleration break down and lead to expulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cultural exchanges and cooperation take place in economic, cultural, intellectual, and social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and intolerance) that emerged at the end of the Middle Ages and examine aspects of inter-religious encounters and dialogues today. We will discuss not only the significance of Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but also assess these encounters as a case study in the broader history of religious diversity, pluralism, and conflict.",

The second half will survey ways in which this theory can be applied to English grammar and to the design of programming languages. We will concentrate on syntax, but will also pay some attention to theories of meaning. NOTE: CS 401 (Java) combined with Python knowledge can be used as a substitute for the Python prerequisite (CS 8, 10-12). Please email the instructor.",

Industrial sectors, such as in wind turbines, oil and natural gas exploration and production, natural gas and hydrogen vehicle storage tanks, high-speed and precision machinery, etc., are today the largest user of composites, surpassing aerospace industries. Other applications are in semiconductor manufacturing equipment; automobile engines, bodies, brakes and clutches; energy storage flywheels; gas turbine engines; process industries equipment; data storage equipment; medical diagnostic equipment; prosthetics and orthotics, etc. The advantages of composite materials stem from their outstanding strengths and stiffnesses, low densities, in addition to their unique and tailorable physical properties, including good thermal conductivities compared to copper and thermal expansions that can be varied from high to near zero. Composites, such as metallic, ceramic and carbon materials have both high-temperature and low-temperature capabilities, making them useful in high temperature regimes, e.g. in gas turbine engines, automobile and aircraft brakes. This course offers an in-depth presentation of design, analysis and manufacturing methods for composites, with particular reference to polymer matrix composites. For an efficient use of composites in lightweight structural design applications, this course offers the needed fundamental understanding of the structure, properties, and mechanics of composite materials. A typical mechanical analysis and design of composite structures, which are significantly more complex than those of their metallic equivalents due to the anisotropic nature of laminated composite materials, will be presented.",

Unit three focuses on perceptual decision-making and using visual motion as a model system. We will also touch on some data analysis methods for using psychophysical and neuronal data to figure out how we make decisions based on visual information. The fourth unit will focus on perception of color and depth and on how visual perception develops after birth. Throughout the course, we will focus on what neural mechanisms can tell us about how we perceive the visual world and on how we can design experiments to better understand the relationship between neural mechanisms and perception.",

In the initial laboratory portion of the course, human and animal brain tissue will be examined to provide students a first-hand knowledge of the structures that make up the brain and spinal cord. Subsequently, major journal articles that were key in establishing the scientific principles discussed in NROSCI 1011 will be reviewed. This portion of the course will allow students to gain insights into the methods that neuroscientists use to learn about the nervous system. This is a three credit course and will count as an advance elective for majors. Please go to the Honors College for Special Permission.",

In the course, students will explore contemporary social realities throughout the Portuguese-speaking world (namely Brazil, Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde) through the close and critical reading of texts, literature, film, short videos, podcast episodes, TV programs, among other mediums.  Students will be exposed to issues regarding gender, race, nation, sexuality, class, status, among other issues within a contemporary context.  Students are expected to engage in critical discussions with the materials and the varying perspectives of their peers.  The purpose of this course is not to merely passively digest content but to also think and express oneself critically in reaction to cultural representations both from the perspective of the respective nation and also from US perspectives.  It is also necessary to keep in mind that rather than attempting an exhaustive survey of the Portuguese-speaking world in its entirety, the course provides merely a glimpse into the cultural offerings of these diverse and vast geographical regions;  it is also an attempt to promote global and cultural understanding.  Hopefully, through this exposure, it is also a starting point for further exploration and research in studies of the Portuguese-speaking world and beyond.",

Students will learn how the court reached its decisions, who some significant justices have been, how the court considered contending arguments, and what the consequences of these decisions for our political system have been. Topics include the development of judicial review and close analysis of the way in which the court has addressed the two major structural features of the U.S. Constitution ' separation of powers and federalism in an historic and contemporary setting. Specific issues in these areas are struggles over presidential and congressional power and national versus state power. We also address issues regarding civil liberties and civil rights.

This course provides students with the concepts and theories necessary for understanding and analyzing the various policies and proposals put forth by food producers, consumer groups, politicians, government regulators, and other food-related interest groups. This course is based on the premise that rational and desirable policy goals for any society are to create and maintain food systems that promote health, protect the environment, are sustainable, and support the livelihoods of participants, but that powerful forces in society including large businesses seeking profits and school boards protecting budgets may oppose this premise in theory or practice.  Hence: politics. The course considers how the U.S. and other governments develop policies aimed at ensuring a sufficient, nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable, and sustainable food supply.  Drawing on contemporary case studies, it examines: why and how governments establish food and nutrition policies; how stakeholders in the food system use the political system to influence policy; the cultural, social, economic, and political factors that influence stakeholder and government positions on policy issues.",

The technology maps a million streamlines (0.1mm diameters sets of axons) per person providing 93 miles of tracts within the head involving 40 tracts connecting 170 brain areas.  We can follow tracts from source to destination mapping projection fields with high accuracy.   The fibers can be visualized and quantified providing circuit diagrams of cortical networks.  These techniques will advance the study of brain systems, disorders, development, neuropathology, and neurosurgery. Students will perform projects individually or in groups analyzing collected data or developing new analysis or biomedical methods.  Students can do projects that are cognitive neuroscience studies of a brain system or technical development of new methods. Sample projects might include mapping a sensory system, developmental assessment or automated brain segmentation and circuit tracing and detection of clinical anomalies (e.g., TBI breaks, tumors).  Technical projects might involve better fiber reconstruction, tracking, tract segmentation or developing new visualization or statistical projects.  Students must have some statistics and research experience/course work and consent of the instructor.",

We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideas and issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient settings.

The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for many of the same reasons they are complex and even controversial: Surviving primary sources are fragmented, partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this period to legitimize their own positions. The central goal is to develop an understanding of the diversity of voices in this early period and consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced others; and then follow those voices beyond the Arabian Peninsula to examine manifestations in the North African and Central Asian borderlands.",

Students in this course will learn about this ancient pantheon - how gods functioned in society and how their presence was experienced by those devoted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the late second millennium BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a small group of absolute monotheists based in Jerusalem in the mid-first millennium BCE. Students will become more sophisticated readers of biblical texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect not a homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polytheism. By appropriating and reinterpreting the religious myths of their neighbors, the Israelites arrived at a character of the divine that has proven problematic to many contemporary theologians, particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.",

Subsequently, many Christians were charged with the crime of \"atheism,\" and put to death, as atheism was equivalent to treason. Who were these people who voluntarily embraced their own deaths as a vindication of their faith, and how did Rome justify their extinction? How were they understood by their pagan and Jewish neighbors? This course explores the cultural, political and religious context of Christian martyrs, beginning in second temple Judaism.

Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that religious identities are often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that religion and race are both modern categories rooted in post-enlightenment ideas about what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in european imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples. In particular, we will think about the impact of white supremacy on black religion in the united states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and islamophobia, and contemporary islamophobia in the us. Finally, we will explore the possibilities of anti-racism through faith-based scholarship and activism.",

Part two offers concrete examples of Buddhist modernism by illustrating how Buddhist contemplative practices and doctrines such as sati have been reinterpreted and reformulated in modern psychology. Part three examines how a Japanese Zen practitioner's presentation of Zen compares with psychotherapeutic perspectives on it. Finally, in part four, a Buddhist-inspired psychotherapy widely used in Japan is examined to show how the reformulation of Buddhism to achieve psychotherapeutic goals has occurred in modern times in East Asia, albeit in a way that is distinctive from Buddhist-inspired psychotherapeutic practices in the west.",

The origins and development of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, popular and family religion, and religion and the state are presented within an overall historical framework. As China becomes more and more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practices. In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased \"investment\" in religion. In addition to the study of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in premodern China, the course ends by looking at contemporary beliefs and practices and issues of politics, class, and gender. Our purpose is to gain some exposure to Chinese religious thought and practice, to identify dominant themes underlying Chinese values and behavior, and to explore the syncretic nature of religion in China as each tradition finds expression in and comes to influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture. In this way, we hope to come to understand the critical role played by the various traditions in the unfolding of Chinese history and in the formation of the Chinese view of the world.",

Were Jews the victims of severe persecution and violence everywhere during this period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing religious wars? The answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict and competition between the three major western religious groups, they were also a time of coexistence and cooperation. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplistic stereotypes to deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were the theological, political, and legal contexts in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted in both Christian Europe and the Muslim world? How did these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tolerate the religious \"Other\"? When and why did toleration break down and lead to expulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cultural exchanges and cooperation take place in economic, cultural, intellectual, and social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and intolerance) that emerged at the end of the Middle Ages and examine aspects of inter-religious encounters and dialogues today. We will discuss not only the significance of Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but also assess these encounters as a case study in the broader history of religious diversity, pluralism, and conflict.",

As well, daily life is structured by larger social phenomena. As such, the study of everyday life provides a lens through which to explore such themes as the workings and effects of power, social change or the lack thereof, social inequality, quiescence and resistance, ideology, identity and difference, norms and normativity, subject formation and subjectivity, and practices of meaning making. Our mode of analysis will be to bring sociological concepts and theory to the sites and practices of everyday life to refine our sociological thinking and our understandings of the world. Along with exposing students to different schools of thought with regard to the study of everyday life, this course will provide students with the necessary tools to defamiliarize and denaturalize that which might seem natural, obvious, and axiomatic. It also is designed to help students think about the relationship between social processes and the individual and about what is at stake in understanding how they mutually affect one another in any given context.",

International economic policies such as patent law and trade agreements affect access to and delivery of health services and treatments and contribute to national, racial, and gendered inequities in health care. Climate change increases the prevalence of certain diseases and impacts availability of food and water. In addition, global economic forces shape the possibilities for national and local governments to provide for their citizens' basic human needs such as safe drinking water, nutrition, and a healthy environment.

As a point of departure, several milestones are presented in the sociocultural constructions of masculinity, femininity and sexuality and their respective transformations throughout the 20th century. Similarly, this course examines the themes, dynamics, trends and common sites of sexual diversity in contemporary Mexico. Incorporating a diversity of cultural texts (i.e. novels, essays, newspaper articles, videos, films, art, music, and performance.), this course centers thematically on the gender models that circulated before, during and after the 1910 Revolution, the debates about homosexuality during the decade of the 40s, 50s and 60s, the emergence of activist movement in favor of sexual diversity in the 70s, the cultural production of homosexual themes, the urban space in the development of sexually dissident practices, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, nightlife culture, sexual manifestations in the borderlands and in the indigenous communities of Oaxaca, lesbianism, transsexualism, the debate on queerness, the cultural symbols and practices of the LGBT community in Mexico. This course aims to develop critical thinking skills through the rigorous examination of the assumptions that fix, homogenize and perpetuate the traditional narratives that lead to a dichotomy of sexuality in contemporary Mexico.",

While in religiously-grounded societies punishment is seen as a retribution for an evil act, tendencies in modernity (and post-modernity) privilege the use of punishment as a tool for social reintegration. With the rise of human rights-based doctrines, the characterization of punishment as retribution has proven to be more and more difficult to justify. Even if sayings such as \"paying my debt to society\" are still in use, it is becoming more and more evident - especially in a time of mass incarceration - how incarceration as punishment cannot be the only solution. This course exposes students to ideas of justice as a process aimed at reintegrating wrong-doers in society through a path of reconciliation and re-socialization, so that the end of the process will produce fellow citizens rather than ex-felons.",

            "description": "Social justice and economic justice are popular buzz-words that are closely tied to urban environments: but what do they really mean, and how can we understand them? URBNST 1612 uses critical social geography to interrogate both historical and contemporary social justice movements that claim to protect human rights, fair housing, or to expand definitions of public space and citizenship.  Taken together these agendas form a powerful prescription for social action, one often emerging in urban settings.  Using a combination of lectures, Concept Mapping exercises, and case studies, we will examine the historical and theoretical context for social justice in the city and then evaluate different geographies of social change.  By the end of the course students will be able to use a critical perspective to understand how the rhetoric of social justice is changing the urban geographies of specific cities worldwide.",

We will investigate how the fuzzy concept of sustainability has developed, and look at how principles of urban sustainability are put into practice. In particular, we will look at the Pittsburgh city-region, and draw on examples from Singapore, Auckland (New Zealand), and Tianjin (China). In particular, the class will concentrate on how sustainability is embedded in planning urban structures, organizing for sustainable communities, and mitigating environmental risks and vulnerability. Students will hear from a variety of professionals engaged in sustainable urbanism, and learn about specific tools used to assess sustainability at different geographic scales.",

This course explores two related aspects of global urbanization: changing patterns of urban growth and urbanization, and similarities and differences in the nature of urban processes at the regional level. This course begins by exploring the causes of urbanization, factors driving urban growth, impacts of globalization, and regional variations in urbanization levels at a variety of scales including the global north and global south. In contrast, the second part of the course focuses on the differences and similarities in the characteristics of the economic, social, demographic, and cultural processes that shape urban places and urban life in different regions of the world. The optics covered include, but are not limited to, residential and commercial gentrification, residential segregation, gates communities, common interest developments, and sustainability.",
