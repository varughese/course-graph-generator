Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that religious identities are often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that religion and race are both modern categories rooted in post-enlightenment ideas about what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in European imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples. In particular, we will think about the impact of white supremacy on black religion in the united states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, and contemporary Islamophobia in the US. Finally, we will explore the possibilities of anti-racism through faith-based scholarship and activism.",

Our focus will be on the major archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerusalem and its environs. We will explore the political and religious issues that have emerged from or surround their excavation. Archaeology in the Holy Land has long been driven by a desire to shed light on - or even authenticate - the Bible, while the \"exotic Orient\" was explored in the 19th and early 20th centuries through western expeditions and excavations that served to further colonial interests. These religious and political motivations persist even if their manifestations have shifted with time. Through site tours, museum visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even a day participating in an archaeological excavation, students will gain direct experience with the places that have aroused controversy because of their problematic relationship to biblical and other ancient texts and/or because of their location in politically contested space.",

Through analyses of case studies of biotechnology, medicine, genetics, conservation, agriculture, energy, climate science, and computing around the world, this class will investigate the global dynamics of science and technology. Juxtaposing readings on different scientific fields from around the globe, we will look for recurring themes that connect these studies.

Business people who are involved in technology selection and deployment decisions need a basic knowledge of these areas as well as an understanding the value, costs and benefits they might offer to a business. They also must be able to find out about and evaluate new or emerging technologies and issues that could have relevance in their business situations. They then need to be able to explain all of this to other business people - in business terms.  This course will utilize: lectures and presentations by the instructor and outside speakers to present current and relevant architectures and issues that affect businesses deploying information systems; full-length case studies and class discussion to facilitate the examination of the business implications of and the context in which these system deployment factors are involved; team projects to give the students experience in researching, understanding, evaluating and explaining information technologies and issues within a business context.",

This course focuses on how to gather requirements, achieve a usable first draft, and test and improve that draft. A half-dozen course projects include usability critiques, assessments of users' difficulties in understanding systems, and designs of forms, screen layouts, and icons. A running major project in four parts provides a usability critique of a website or app, followed by empirical tests of usability, followed by suggestions for improvement, and finally, empirical tests of prototype screens (using an easy tool) that would implement improvements. A final presentation is a summary of all four stages that is intended to convince management to provide funds to make the changes.",

Describe and quantify both the defect and the expected improvement.  2. Measure the current performance of the process.  Validate data to make sure it is credible and set the baseline.  3. Analyze and determine the root cause(s) of the defects.  Narrow the causal factors to the vital few.  4. Improve the process to eliminate defects.  Optimize the vital few and their interrelationships.  5. Control the performance of the process.  Lock down the gains.

In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.",

Its goals are to help you engage in writing as a creative, disciplined form of critical inquiry; compose thoughtfully crafted essays that position your ideas among other views; write with precision, nuance, and awareness of textual conventions; and revise your writing by rethinking the assumptions, aims, and effects of prior drafts. This seminar will include readings and writing activities that explore concepts and practices relating to diversity and its established and emerging definitions. Your section may address, for example, issues like race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religious difference, differences in abilities, and economic disparities. You can expect to identify and analyze assumptions about difference, study how texts can generate and perpetuate such assumptions, and explore the consequences of such assumptions. You will also learn how to research and compose with attention to difference. We will read a challenging set of essays to frame our work in the course, but the key texts will be your own writings and those of your classmates. Your focus on student writing will be detailed: you will work closely with the papers that you and your fellow classmates have written, trying to think of ways to make them more precise, interesting, organized, complex, and reflexive. This course is an opportunity to learn how to use reading (published texts, the papers of your classmates, and readers' comments) to help you work on your writing and how to use writing to help you strengthen ways of reading and thinking.

This Topics in Diversity section of WPC will invite students to expand and complicate their understanding of the benefits of workplace diversity and of the problems arising from the unequal distribution of power and privilege across positions (including race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class) in the professions. Students will explore the dynamics of power and hierarchy in their chosen field as they observe daily operations and interactions during work-site field visits, and they will consider how these dynamics perpetuate or diminish inequities and marginalization. Among the topics considered are discrimination in hiring and on the job in terms of employment training, responsibilities, pay, and promotions. Students gain practice articulating their individual diversity as job candidates in resumes and cover letters, and in composing professional documents that address a complaint, seek a remedy, and establish new policies to address hypothetical discriminatory issues that they may experience in the future.",

Through these writing projects and through classroom activities, students will learn about how to find data to use for their writing, how to plan effective utilization of this data in a broader argument, how to responsibly and effectively use word choice and syntax to convey quantified material, how to organize writing reliant on data for both lay and specialized audiences, and how to incorporate data visualization for purposes of understanding and persuasion. There is no need to know anything about statistics; throughout the term we will learn how mathematical encounters with writing can be engaging, exciting, and something we can work on together. We will be going over a handful of statistical concepts in the second half of the course so we can write about them, but the emphasis here will ultimately be on proficiency for the purposes of a given concepts use in writing.

The course focuses on developing the skills needed to write and communicate effectively in health and medical contexts, from writing essays for graduate and professional program applications and documenting research to communicating with patients and staff, writing professional reports and correspondence, and giving conference presentations. Students will gain familiarity with the formal requirements of biomedical abstracts, literature reviews, and research papers, and they will learn effective strategies for conducting secondary research using health science databases and search engines. The course will also introduce techniques for improving documents, structure and style, so that readers can easily grasp, follow, and absorb the significance of the information presented. Students will be introduced to expectations and challenges they are likely to encounter in other common writing scenarios, such as explaining complex information to patients, writing reports for administrators or regulatory agencies, and communication policies or procedures to staff. Different approaches to writing graduate and professional school personal statements will be discussed, and students will draft and revise either personal statements for applications or mission statements articulating their professional visions within a larger ethical framework. Through the course of the term students will work towards completion of a final paper on a medical communication issue, and they will present their findings in a conference-style format, at the end of the semester.",

The course provides students with the opportunity to develop a portfolio of practical and analytical policy-related writing by grounding our work in current discussions about diversity (including race, gender, LGBT+, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class). In this writing-intensive class, students will write a variety of documents, such as a history memo, a set of responses to the readings, a letter of public comment, an op-ed, a polemical essay, and a final policy memo, related to a specific and properly-scaled diversity policy issue. The course will address the specialized use of language, conventions and formats, premises, motives, and purposes related to policy documents and arguments in light of diversity. By preparing both reflective academic and professional policy documents, students will master not only the basics of policy writing, but, through their own research and writing, the rhetorical and critical thinking skills necessary to create effective policy. Students will learn to employ methods of inquiry, analysis, and composition characteristic of written and oral policy discussions as they relate to diversity questions, concerns, and legal requirements. We will read broadly and deeply, and engaged, informed class discussion responding to reading and current policy questions is a cornerstone of the class. We will explore how the explicit and implicit history and applications of public and private policies have created long-standing outcomes that are often taken for granted, and address ways to change and improve those outcomes.",

The course is for responsible students who are interested in writing for this journal or running social media to promote the journal. The team will work with a teacher who will serve as managing editor and also faculty member in charge of the project. The group will learn about writing, editing, and PR while producing the online literary magazine. You can also expect to learn more about free speech and social justice while working with writers who are under threat in their home countries. Weekly meetings on campus will focus on learning about the context for the work, learning good practices for professional writing, editing, and PR, reading work by writers in exile, and workshopping your articles for publication. Interviews for articles will be in-person or via Skype. Expect to spend 10-12 hours a week working on this project. You will also need to attend class. A monthly meeting will be held at City of Asylum on the Northside (easily accessible by bus).",

Making is situated at the intersection of social media, the online gift economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with one's physical environment. Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures -the free sharing of code to enable collaborative development - making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. MakerSpaces and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the Internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will begin by looking at the history and philosophy of open source software development, and then the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have together given rise to critical maker culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printing assignments, students will form groups and develop collaborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a topic of your choice and in a medium of your choice. The aim of this course is to \"close the circuit\" between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. Critical making is about critically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. By the end of the semester, you will become a critical maker!

It examines the share both ways of knowing have had in shaping our culture and our ideas by studying (and developing critical perspectives on) both scientific and literary texts. Its goal is to produce an understanding of the common history of literature and science. The course usually focuses on a theme, issue, or topic that has historical range and contemporary relevance. Different versions of the course might focus on social, literary, and scientific understandings of gender; the social, literary, and scientific attitudes toward death and the dead; or the social, literary, and scientific definitions and theories about the \"\"human.\"\" Though works of science fiction may be studied, this is not a course in science fiction. This course should be of particular interest to students in the sciences, students of literature, students of philosophy, and students of history.",

            "description": "What is flexible device manufacturing?  What is green manufacturing? What is cybermanufacturing?  Importantly, how do these emerging \"types\" of manufacturing differ from traditional manufacturing?  It is important to recognize that global manufacturing is undergoing major transformations nowadays. The confluence of new advanced materials, emerging fabrication technologies, and connected cyber-physical systems is creating paradigm shifts for the ways products are conceived, made, distributed, used, and disposed.  In the ever-increasing competition of \"making things\" of value to consumers, many industries are now reinventing themselves to cope with this new reality.  This class covers the fundamentals behind major global trends, and their implication for the future of manufacturing from an engineering perspective. Topics covered include the following:   (1) How the need for flexible and wearable devices is driving innovation in new materials and fabrication processes beyond the traditional microfabrication techniques adopted in the semiconductor industry.    (2) How protein-based materials, degradable polymers, and novel recycling technologies are paving the way for more sustainable manufacturing of consumer products.  (3) How data analytics and internet of things (IoT) technologies are enabling a new generation of digital manufacturing systems referred to as Industry 4.0, and beyond.",

This course is based on experiential learning: through interactive discussions, small-team exercises, maker assignments, workshops and hands-on projects, students will obtain an introduction to design thinking, 'maker culture' and systems engineering. ENGR 1716 is an upper division version of freshman honors ENGR 0716.  It is for sophomore, junior and senior level students. We will explore user-centric design principles, low-resolution prototyping and experience prototyping, basic building elements for systems such as sensors, computer controllers, actuators and displays, materials and methods for prototyping, and ways to analyze and troubleshoot systems. Students will gain an introduction to 'smart systems': automated systems that can sense the world and automatically respond in useful ways. We will also focus on the user interface: how to create control and display interfaces that enhance users' ability to operate systems effectively and efficiently.",

The course address the historical shifts in the cultural understanding of gender roles, class belonging, consumption habits and expectations, the international circulation of craftmanship and celebrities, and technological innovation.  We will start addressing the anthropology of body ornamentation, gender markings and the difference between costume and fashion. Our historical point of departure is the grand arrival of Catherine De Medici from Florence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France.  We then follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of European (and eventually international) fashion, together with Italian cities like Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour through London during the \"dandy\" era of the early 19th century and the \"mod\" and \"punk\" trends of the decades between 1960 and 1980.

These various speech acts will serve a larger framework of real life scenarios students may encounter later on in their studies or careers, for example when interviewing for a job, when interviewing others for a job, when speaking in front of a group, when speaking with colleagues, when running a meeting, when providing consulting services.

This includes planning successful events, running effective meetings, communicating science, writing grants, accounting & mind-numbing IRS paperwork, avoiding burn-out, and dealing with the media, volunteers, government and people who don't agree with you. It can be overwhelming even to those who know what to expect! And don't forget about the actual goal: Making a difference.  This course covers the \"inner workings\" of environmental advocacy. We go beyond the slogans, logos, direct mail, and big events to study what's behind the nonprofit world, what it takes to succeed at the grassroots.

To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.",

Ultimately, these materials may be read as a texts that inform our understanding of culture and social life and prompt such questions as: how does popular culture (re)construct our sense of \"ordinary\" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cultural forms dismissed and others more readily accepted? What social processes bring cultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a variety of forms such as: music, art, television, collectibles, internet, and social media. Students will consider examples from Western, non-Western, and \"global\" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, and ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular culture, material culture, representation, and consumerism, and power and resistance. It will also address these phenomenon over time. This course will make especially strong use of contemporary and popular media such as video clips, internet media and images, and music.",

The goal of this course is to assist students in developing an understanding of the ways in which science has constructed our understanding of gender and sexuality since the nineteenth century, as well as the lived experiences of people within the scientific community who shape and navigate these concepts. To accomplish this goal, we will apply feminist theory, including feminist critiques of the history of medicine, psychology, and science, and gender theory, to an investigation of the evolution of scientific knowledge regarding gender and sexuality, as well as race, disability, and health.  We will also explore the ways in which people, especially women, people of color, and transpeople have interacted with technology, shaped scientific discourse.  In each course lecture and discussion, we will focus on a broad range of scientific fields, discourses, and narratives to construct a comprehensive understanding of the scientific knowledge and identity in the modern world.  While the readings focus largely on American and Western examples and experiences, class discussions and presentations will expand the scope of this class considerably, allowing students to understand the global relationship of gender and science.",

While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses.

The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave,  and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth.  The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.",

Latin America offers rich opportunities to study cases of artists and architects who worked in the service of governmental regimes during the twentieth century, such as Diego Rivera in Mexico and Oscar Niemeyer in Brazil. At the same time, we will consider historical moments in which artists employed their artworks to challenge or subvert political repression, as occurred in Ecuador in the 1930s and in Chile during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Beyond politics, this course focuses on the tensions indigenous vs. cosmopolitan, urban vs. rural, rich vs. poor, and the international dialogues that have informed the production and reception of art and architecture in Latin America from the age of independence to the present day.",

The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for many of the same reasons they are complex and even controversial: Surviving primary sources are fragmented, partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this period to legitimize their own positions. The central goal is to develop an understanding of the diversity of voices in this early period and consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced others; and then follow those voices beyond the Arabian Peninsula to examine manifestations in the North African and Central Asian borderlands.",

Some common themes repeat themselves in each of the country case studies: the role of the state, the interaction between domestic and international factors, the relationship between bureaucrats and politicians, and the development of various institutions. Other topics and readings highlight national specificities, revealing unique circumstances that differentiate the experiences of one country form another. The second half of the course will focus on common themes and contemporary challenges shared by countries in East Asia including, but not limited to, rapidly aging populations, industrialization and green technology, competition for energy sources and commodities, and food security.",

The origins and development of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, popular and family religion, and religion and the state are presented within an overall historical framework. As China becomes more and more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practices. In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased \"investment\" in religion. In addition to the study of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in premodern China, the course ends by looking at contemporary beliefs and practices and issues of politics, class, and gender. Our purpose is to gain some exposure to Chinese religious thought and practice, to identify dominant themes underlying Chinese values and behavior, and to explore the syncretic nature of religion in China as each tradition finds expression in and comes to influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture. In this way, we hope to come to understand the critical role played by the various traditions in the unfolding of Chinese history and in the formation of the Chinese view of the world.",

How can we understand the rise of mass consumption in the postwar era?

            "description": "Mind and medicine deals with fundamental problems and questions that arise in considering the nature of mental health, mental illness, and branches of medicine that aim to promote mental health and treat mental illness. We will begin by considering the concepts of 'health', 'disease' and 'illness' in general, and several different models of medicine. From there we will move on to a consideration of the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We will examine some explanatory successes in the domain of physical health and disease, and consider how those successes were achieved. In the second half of the course we will look at controversies over the question of whether there is such a thing as mental illness, and if so, how one is to define, diagnose and treat it. In order to better understand what is at stake, we will explore these controversies by focusing on a specific mental illness, schizophrenia. Looking at recent research on schizophrenia will allow us to see the extent to which the kind of understanding we have achieved in physical medicine is or is not to be expected with serious mental illness. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medicine and psychiatry; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about foundational questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is also part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0613 (Morality and Medicine) but may be taken independently.

It is often said that America is the only place in the world that treats death as optional.  Once upon a time, we couldn't have open, public conversations about breast cancer, because the word could not be uttered aloud.  In many places, it is just as hard today to have an open, public conversation about death and dying.  This phenomenon is not just a social more; it affects the practice of many professions and entire segments of our economy and society.  This course will explore our individual and cultural reactions to mortality, the ways in which dying in today's America is different from dying throughout history or elsewhere in the world, and the responses of a variety of professions, both within the field of healthcare and beyond, to their encounters with people in the various stages of dying.

But given competing definitions of fairness, how should we decide what it means for an algorithm to be unbiased? Machine vision algorithms are systematically less likely to recognize faces of people of color. Since many face recognition algorithms are used for surveillance, would improving these algorithms promote justice? Deep fakes may pose serious challenges to democratic discourse, as faked videos of political leaders making incendiary statements cast doubt on the provenance of real videos. Do the researchers developing these algorithms, often academics funded by National Science Foundation grants, have an obligation to desist? In a field filled with such vexing questions, the ethical issue most commonly addressed by the media is whether a self-driving car should swerve to hit one person to avoid hitting two.  In this class, we will go beyond the headlines to explore the ethics of technology. We will discuss issues such as transparency, bias and fairness, surveillance, automation and work, the politics of artifacts, the epistemology of deep fakes, and more. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify crucial moral and epistemic issues in contemporary technology and choose between solutions to these difficult problems.",

However, approaching such questions empirically does not reveal the underlying assumptions one might incorporate into one's thinking when formulating questions, developing experiments, and interpreting results. This course will couple metaphysical theories of mind with contemporary research in both cognitive neuroscience and neurobiology. Throughout the class, we will try to answer some of the questions that popularly occupy contemporary philosophy of neuroscience debates, as well as interrogate and identify, philosophically, where and how these questions, including the research they prompt, arose in the first place. Finally, as neuroscience is a largely tool-driven discipline, students will learn about a range of neurotechnologies and explore whether or not these technologies are likely to get us any closer to reading the mind from the brain.

The course address the historical shifts in the cultural understanding of gender roles, class belonging, consumption habits and expectations, the international circulation of craftmanship and celebrities, and technological innovation.  We will start addressing the anthropology of body ornamentation, gender markings and the difference between costume and fashion. Our historical point of departure is the grand arrival of Catherine De Medici from Florence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France.  We then follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of European (and eventually international) fashion, together with Italian cities like Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour through London during the \"dandy\" era of the early 19th century and the \"mod\" and \"punk\" trends of the decades between 1960 and 1980. Punk leads us into a discussion of current international \"anti-fashion\" trends, such as the politics and economics of privilege, cheap labor and environmental concerns about \"fast fashion.\"  This course is taught in English.",

We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideas and issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient near east, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient settings. Of course, because the myths are expressions of human thought, we may find that in studying them we also come to better understand ourselves.",

Our focus will be on the major archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerusalem and its environs. We will explore the political and religious issues that have emerged from or surround their excavation. Archaeology in the Holy Land has long been driven by a desire to shed light on-or even authenticate-the Bible, while the \"exotic Orient\" was explored in the 19th and early 20th centuries through western expeditions and excavations that served to further colonial interests. These religious and political motivations persist even if their manifestations have shifted with time. Through site tours, museum visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even a day participating in an archaeological excavation, students will gain direct experience with the places that have aroused controversy because of their problematic relationship to biblical and other ancient texts and/or because of their location in politically contested space.",

Industrial sectors, such as in wind turbines, oil and natural gas exploration and production, natural gas and hydrogen vehicle storage tanks, high-speed and precision machinery, etc., are today the largest user of composites, surpassing aerospace industries. Other applications are in semiconductor manufacturing equipment; automobile engines, bodies, brakes and clutches; energy storage flywheels; gas turbine engines; process industries equipment; data storage equipment; medical diagnostic equipment; prosthetics and orthotics, etc. The advantages of composite materials stem from their outstanding strengths and stiffnesses, low densities, in addition to their unique and tailorable physical properties, including good thermal conductivities compared to copper and thermal expansions that can be varied from high to near zero. Composites, such as metallic, ceramic and carbon materials have both high-temperature and low-temperature capabilities, making them useful in high temperature regimes, e.g. in gas turbine engines, automobile and aircraft brakes. This course offers an in-depth presentation of design, analysis and manufacturing methods for composites, with particular reference to polymer matrix composites. For an efficient use of composites in lightweight structural design applications, this course offers the needed fundamental understanding of the structure, properties, and mechanics of composite materials. A typical mechanical analysis and design of composite structures, which are significantly more complex than those of their metallic equivalents due to the anisotropic nature of laminated composite materials, will be presented.",

Where class and wealth used to be deciding factors for romantic love, there now emerged the concept of the soulmate, who could be anyone. In this course, we will watch American romantic comedies of the last 100 years, paying particular attention to how the development of the soundtrack has changed what love sounds and feels like.Students will develop skills in closely analyzing sound and image in film, critically interpreting popular culture in relation to broader events in society, and thinking about the relation between music, identity, and politics. In particular, we will together develop answers to the following questions: how did capitalism, social justice movements, the changing nature of work, and other cultural transformations affect what people expected from intimate union? What aesthetic norms for representing romance changed alongside cultural norms? How is the narrative of love inflected by race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religious difference, ability difference, and/or economic disparity?",

The second unit covers object recognition, cognitive factors that influence visual perception, and how the way we are planning to use visual information affects the way it is encoded in the brain. Unit three focuses on perceptual decision-making and using visual motion as a model system. We will also touch on some data analysis methods for using psychophysical and neuronal data to figure out how we make decisions based on visual information. The fourth unit will focus on perception of color and depth and on how visual perception develops after birth. Throughout the course, we will focus on what neural mechanisms can tell us about how we perceive the visual world and on how we can design experiments to better understand the relationship between neural mechanisms and perception.",

Students are expected to engage in critical discussions with the materials and the varying perspectives of their peers.

Depending on the interests, area of expertise, and inclinations of the particular instructor, some of these may be emphasized more heavily than others.",

We do this by analyzing constitutional interpretation by the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts in its major decisions. Students will learn how the court reached its decisions, who some significant justices have been, how the court considered contending arguments, and what the consequences of these decisions for our political system have been. Topics include the development of judicial review and close analysis of the way in which the court has addressed the two major structural features of the U.S. Constitution ' separation of powers and federalism in an historic and contemporary setting. Specific issues in these areas are struggles over presidential and congressional power and national versus state power. We also address issues regarding civil liberties and civil rights. Students should find this course helpful in reaching a more sophisticated understanding of the major issues of constitutional law in American life, as well as providing a useful background to the cases and kinds of legal analysis they may pursue in further study in law school or other graduate study.",

This course provides students with the concepts and theories necessary for understanding and analyzing the various policies and proposals put forth by food producers, consumer groups, politicians, government regulators, and other food-related interest groups. This course is based on the premise that rational and desirable policy goals for any society are to create and maintain food systems that promote health, protect the environment, are sustainable, and support the livelihoods of participants, but that powerful forces in society including large businesses seeking profits and school boards protecting budgets may oppose this premise in theory or practice.  Hence: politics. The course considers how the U.S. and other governments develop policies aimed at ensuring a sufficient, nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable, and sustainable food supply.  Drawing on contemporary case studies, it examines: why and how governments establish food and nutrition policies; how stakeholders in the food system use the political system to influence policy; the cultural, social, economic, and political factors that influence stakeholder and government positions on policy issues.",

Additionally, specific information will be added to the Notes section as it becomes available and edited by individual events and instructors each term.  Fall Terms:  Global Health:  This course engages the interdisciplinary nature of global health by approaching the issue through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) developed by the United Nations. With an applied focus, the course will assist students in engaging and advocating for a community on a global health issue through a policy memo. For more information see the Global Studies web site or contact global@pitt.edu.  Spring Terms:  Cities in Transformation:  This course views cities as hubs where patterns, connections, discussions, and the processes shape such issues as social justice, economic development, technology, migration, the environment among others. By examining cities as a lens, this course encourages students to examine cities as a system for discussing social processes being built and rebuilt.

It opened the door to German re-unification, the European Union, the enlargement of NATO, globalization, two decades of U.S. superpower status, political realignments in Latin America and Africa, and the rise of Asia. This series will explore the impact and global legacies of the Cold War thirty years after the Iron Curtain fell. Students who enroll will attend at least 10 events, one of which must be the concluding roundtable on December 5. In addition, they will write three short reflection essays.\"",

This class is meant to be a gentle introduction to the emerging field of computational social science, where we study the opportunities and challenges with both collecting and exploring digitally available political and social information such as text, geo-locations and social media connections to better understand human decisions and interactions. We begin by going back to basics, exploring the reasons and ways individuals and policy-makers use and misuse data. We then turn our focus to flexible computational tools for data collection and visualization and how they can provide unique help in answering important questions such as what causes war and violence, who represses human rights, and what parties are likely to win elections. By the end of the class, students will be exposed not only to coding and computer languages that are often used in data analytics in industry, government and academia, including bash, Python and R, but how these languages can be used to better understand the changing digital world that surrounds us.",

Many forms of prevention and intervention are used in education, human services, and healthcare, but few such practices have 'practice-based evidence' conducted in real-world settings which validate their continued use. Thus, in this course, students will gain knowledge and skills in evidence-based contextual and individual interventions, their content, methodology, implementation, and evaluation. The course will help students who are interventionists but is not primarily clinical in orientation. Rather, it is designed to prepare future leaders ' practitioners, researchers, program administrators/directors, program evaluators, and policy specialists - in best practices and their implications",
